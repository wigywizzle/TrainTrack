# TrainTrack
This is the project page for the CS440 Train Track Project

# About the project
The TrainTrack project was assigned by Dr. Rodney Tosten.  The basic idea of the project is to rewrite the ATSC monitor that is available for Windows, so that a limited version of the application is available as a web based application.  For this project, we will focus on creating a working version of train locations in the Harrisburg area.
